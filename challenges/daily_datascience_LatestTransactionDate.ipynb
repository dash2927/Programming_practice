    "First, we need to get the latest transaction date for each user, along with the number of products they have purchased. This can be done in a subquery where we GROUP BY user_id and take a COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) to get the number of products they have purchased, and a MAX(transaction_date::date) to get the latest transaction date (while casting to a date). Then, using this subquery, we can simply do an aggregation by the transaction date column in the previous subquery, while doing a COUNT() on the number of users, and a SUM() on the number of products:\n",
